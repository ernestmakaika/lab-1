    <p>In the Spring Semester of the 2019-2020 Academic Year, Ernest worked on a semester-long project in which he designed 
        <br /> a database for We Are Family Foundation. The database was developed to keep track of the current Global Teen Teaders,
        <br /> their projects and details about the social ventures that the Global Teen Leaders run. Specifically,
        <br /> the database was designed to perform the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Keep track of all social entrepreneurship ventures run by the GTLs</li>
            <li>Provide available funding opportunities for the GTLs</li>
            <li>Track the progress made by each Global Teen Leader during the entire mentorship process.</li>
            <li>Keep track of all coalition partners, mentors and other industry
            <br />   professionals who are involved in the Three Dot Dash Program.</li>
            </ul>
